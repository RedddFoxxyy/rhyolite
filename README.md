### Rhyolite is a simple markdown editor build using tauri framework that allows user to edit and work on markdown files.


Please note that **major changes are ongoing**. For the most stable experience, wait for a new binary release or compile the source from the `master-v0.1.4-old` branch.


## **Current Updates**

### Changes Underway

- Frontend is being worked on and new features are being added.
- Working on a adding support for more markdowns.
- Project renamed to **Rhyolite**.

> Rhyolite is inspired by volcanic rocks, much like Obsidian. The project is my way to contribute and grow as a developer while sharing something meaningful with the open-source community.
