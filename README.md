### [Rhyolite](https://rhyolite.xyz/) is a simple markdown editor build using tauri framework that allows user to edit and work on markdown files.
> Rhyolite is inspired by volcanic rocks, much like Obsidian. The project is my way to contribute and grow as a developer while sharing something meaningful with the open-source community.
> 
> Rhyolite was a fork of [fextify](https://github.com/face-hh/fextify), but was later rewritten from scratch,
> using sveltekit for the frontend and tauri version was changed from v1 to v2. As of now this project does not
> share any similarities to the [fextify](https://github.com/face-hh/fextify) project.


## **Current Updates**

### Changes Underway

- Frontend is being worked on and new features are being added.
- A app-state based system that uses tauri events is being written in the `state-refactor` branch.
- Working on a adding support for more markdowns.


## For New Contributors

1. If you want to contribute to the app, you can work on any of the issues that have not been assigned to anyone.
2. Join our **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/K6FAd8FTma)** to collaborate effectively.
3. The project uses lld as the default linker for the rust code on linux systems so make sure you have lld(llvm linker) installed
on your linux system.(If you wish to use the default linker, comment out the code in .cargo when you build).
