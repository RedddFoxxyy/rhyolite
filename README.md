### [Rhyolite](https://rhyolite.xyz/) is a simple markdown editor build using tauri framework that allows user to edit and work on markdown files.

> Rhyolite is inspired by volcanic rocks, much like Obsidian. The project is my way to contribute and grow as a developer while sharing something meaningful with the open-source community.
>
> Rhyolite was a fork of [fextify](https://github.com/face-hh/fextify), but was later rewritten from scratch,
> using sveltekit for the frontend and tauri version was changed from v1 to v2. As of now this project does not share any similarities to the [fextify](https://github.com/face-hh/fextify) project.
