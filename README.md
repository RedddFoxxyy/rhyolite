#### [Rhyolite](https://rhyolite.xyz/) is a simple markdown editor build using Rust with Freya that allows user to edit and work on markdown files.

> Rhyolite is inspired by volcanic rock rhyolite, which is a type of igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of lava.
>
> Rhyolite was a fork of [fextify](https://github.com/face-hh/fextify), but was later rewritten from scratch,
> using sveltekit for the frontend and tauri version was changed from v1 to v2. As of now this project does not share any similarities to the [fextify](https://github.com/face-hh/fextify) project.
>
> Update: The project is now completely written in rust, and is being rewritten to use the [FREYA GUI](https://freyaui.dev/) library for the UI, making the app completely native code with rust.

## **Current Updates**

- The app is being migrated from Tauri(Svelte) to Freya(Rust) based UI.(WIP).
- The [0.1.10-freeze](https://github.com/RedddFoxxyy/rhyolite/tree/0.1.10-freeze) branch has the old code for the old tauri version of the app which will not be maintained anymore.
